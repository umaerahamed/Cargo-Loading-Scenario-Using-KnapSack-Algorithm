# Cargo-Loading-Scenario-Using-KnapSack-Algorithm
Efficient cargo loading is critical in logistics and transportation. The challenge is to de-termine which items to include in the truck to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight and volume limits. This problem can be modeled as a variant of the knapsack problem with dual constraints.
